## Overview (Vision):
lego-build aims to make development fun again by automating routine tasks, like creating special files and folders that have the same boilerplate code or pattern. It also aims to be extremely flexible and extendable. The idea is that the power lies in the hands of the developer.

## The Problem:
Building large react applications is **hard**. There‚Äôs a lot of boilerplate code that goes into it. Want to create just a small component? You have to create about 3 or 4 files ‚Äî the component file, a CSS file, an index file, and in some cases a test file. Now imagine doing this about 10 different times for a React project with 10 components (which could even be considered a small project!). It‚Äôs worse when you begin adding extra libraries like Redux. Need a new state? Create a new file (reducer) or even two! (plus an action). To someone just starting out with React, this problem may seem trivial, but someone who has built several React apps understands how repetitive, boring and time consuming creating all these files and boilerplate code can be. The solution? Us!

## The Solution:
Imagine a tool that allows you create all 3 or 4 files needed to make your react component ‚Äî in just one line! Need a new redux reducer? Run the command easily in your terminal and have the file plus the boilerplate already written for you. What if the tool also allowed you have your own commands for your own ‚Äòspecial‚Äô files or folders? For example, say you‚Äôre following the atomic model in designing, what if you could extend the tool easily, in a way that you can easily create an atom, molecule, or organism in just one line? We are this tool! **A tool that could be bent to the will of the developer** and can adapt to whatever project structure you need.

## The Philosophy
React is unopinionated. You‚Äôve probably heard this a million times. The implication is that while every developer tries to maintain some structure while working, each structure is different, so a tool to create React ‚Äòspecial‚Äô files and folders needs to be flexible. Though react is unopinionated, there‚Äôs something common to all React projects, it‚Äôs these ‚Äòspecial‚Äô files and folders that bring the app to life. It could be a component folder, a component file, a page folder, an atom, a molecule, a reducer, a hook etc. We call these ‚Äòspecial‚Äô structures building blocks, or just blocks for short. Every React project is made up of them, without them, the app doesn‚Äôt exist. So we are building a tool that helps you easily make such blocks, or mould them.

## The goals

- Build a flexible, easy to use tool that can be used to mould react blocks.
- Enable people start with as little configuration as possible.
- Write easy to understand docs.
- Create an online tool for people to make their config file without writing the code themselves.
- Allow people to rename blocks easily.
- Build a platform that allows people share templates to support different folder structures.
- Pick a short name so typing the CLI commands is easy.
- Have an aesthetic CLI, meaning we will use nice colors and fun language.

## Things to clarify

- How do people organize their React projects normally? This will help us know how our default configuration will be, then it‚Äôll also determine if I‚Äôll include the concept of ‚Äòsub-blocks‚Äô (More on this later).
- Most importantly, what should be the name of the tool?
- Will we build a backend for that feature that allows users share templates, or will we use an already existing platform to make life easy?
- How do most people organize their redux files?
- Do people actually test their React components? (To know if we‚Äôll include test files by default)

 All these will be clarified through user research.
 
## Side notes
- Keywords to consider when picking the name are: BLOCK, MOULD, BUILD, REACT, FLEXIBLE, ARCHITECT. This is not an exhaustive list.
- This will most likely be a no-profit project, though ideas on how to monetize will be appreciated
- Please don‚Äôt share this with anyone just yetü§≤üèæ, let them not tiff our idea. The package itself will actually be easy for anyone to build, what might take time will be building the documentation site, the platform to share templates, the tool to generate a config file easily, and all those extra stuff. So someone can use this idea and build just the tool in less than a week.
